    <h1>Discover the world’s most fascinating aquatic life!</h1>
    </p>
    <p>Aquatic life under our oceans, lakes, rivers, and streams is amazing! From microscopic zooplankton to the largest
        animal on earth, the blue whale, underwater life comes in all possible shapes and sizes. With 71% of the earth
        being covered with water, it is no wonder we are so fascinated with what lies beneath the surface. In fact,
        scientists estimate that there are nearly 1 million different species of aquatic animals. Freshwater ecosystems
        are home mainly to fish, invertebrates, and reptiles, whereas the ocean contains a wide array of marine life
        including fish, mollusks, crustaceans, reptiles, sharks, and marine mammals like whales, dolphins, seals, and
        manatees.</p>

    <h2>THE SHARKS</h2>

    <p>
        Sharks are a group of elasmobranch fish characterized by their cartilaginous skeletons, streamlined bodies, and
        multiple rows of sharp teeth. They have existed for over 400 million years, predating dinosaurs. Sharks play a
        crucial role in marine ecosystems as apex predators, helping maintain the balance by controlling the population
        of other marine species. There are over 500 species of sharks, ranging from the tiny dwarf lanternshark to the
        massive whale shark. Despite their fearsome reputation, many shark species are threatened due to overfishing,
        habitat loss, and climate change, leading to growing conservation efforts to protect these vital ocean
        inhabitants. Sharks are spread across 512 described and 23 underdescribed species in eight
        orders.Sharks most likely to attack</p>

    <h2>THE WHALES</h2>
    <p>Whales are magnificent marine mammals, distinct from fish due to their warm-blooded nature, air-breathing lungs,
        and live births. Unlike fish, which breathe through gills and are cold-blooded, whales belong to the cetacean
        family, which includes dolphins and porpoises. Whales are divided into two main categories: baleen whales, which
        filter food through baleen plates, and toothed whales, which hunt using echolocation. Their size ranges from the
        relatively small dwarf sperm whale to the enormous blue whale, the largest animal ever known to have lived on
        Earth. Whales play a crucial role in marine ecosystems, influencing the food chain and contributing to ocean
        health through nutrient cycling. Despite their significance, many species face threats from hunting, pollution,
        and climate change. Conservation efforts are vital to protect these incredible creatures and ensure the balance
        and health of ocean environments.</p>

        <p>Scientific name: Cetacea</p>
        <p>Speed: Varies by species, but can range from 5 to 20 miles per hour (8 to 32 kilometers per hour); some species like the orca can reach speeds up to 34 mph (56 km/h).</p>
        <p>Lifespan: Varies by species, typically ranging from 20 to over 100 years. For example, blue whales can live up to 90 years, while bowhead whales can live over 200 years.</p>

    <h2>THE DOLPHINS</h2>
    <p>The dolphin fish, commonly known as mahi-mahi, is a vibrant and popular species found in warm ocean waters worldwide. Recognizable by their dazzling, iridescent colors ranging from bright blues and greens to golden yellows, dolphin fish are not only visually striking but also highly sought after by sport fishermen. They are known for their agility and acrobatic leaps when hooked, making them a thrilling catch. Mahi-mahi are fast-growing and can reach up to 40 pounds in weight. They have a relatively short lifespan, usually living up to five years. These fish are also prized for their culinary value; their firm, white flesh is mild and versatile, making it a favorite in many seafood dishes. Sustainable fishing practices are essential to maintain their populations, ensuring that future generations can continue to enjoy both the sport and the flavor of this remarkable species.</p>
    
    
    <p>Scientific name: Delphinidae</p>
    <p>Speed: Dolphins can reach speeds of up to 37 km/h (23 mph).</p>

    <h2>THE SEAHORSES AND PIPEFISHES</h2>
    <p>Seahorses and pipefishes are fascinating members of the Syngnathidae family, known for their unique body structures and reproductive behaviors. Seahorses have a distinctive horse-like head and a prehensile tail that they use to anchor themselves to seagrasses and corals. Pipefishes, on the other hand, have elongated bodies resembling pipes. Both species share a remarkable reproductive trait: males carry and give birth to the young. Female seahorses and pipefishes deposit eggs into a specialized brood pouch on the male's abdomen, where he fertilizes and incubates them until they hatch. These fish are found in shallow, temperate, and tropical waters worldwide, often residing in seagrass beds, coral reefs, and mangroves. Due to habitat destruction and overfishing, many seahorse and pipefish populations are under threat, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect these unique and delicate marine species.</p>
   
    <p><h3>SEAHORSES</h3></p>
    <p>Scientific name: Hippocampus</p>
    <p>Speed: Seahorses swim very slowly, with speeds up to 1.5 meters per hour.</p>
    <p>Lifespan: 1 to 5 years, depending on the species.</p>
    <p>Term for young: Fry</p>
    <p>Clade: Syngnathiformes</p>

    <p><h3>PIPEFISHES</h3></p>
    <p>Scientific name: Syngnathus and other genera within the family Syngnathidae</p>
    <p>Speed:Similar to seahorses, they swim slowly, but exact speeds can vary; generally slow-moving.</p>
    <p>Lifespan: 1 to 10 years, depending on the species.</p>
